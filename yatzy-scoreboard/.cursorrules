# Yatzy Scoreboard Project Rules

## Project Overview
- Yatzy scoreboard web application for tracking multiple players' scores
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Uses localStorage for persistence
- Supports responsive icon view with description

## Key Features
- Multi-player score tracking
- Automatic calculation of sums, bonus, and totals
- **Responsive Category View**:
  - Icons and descriptions are always visible side-by-side (wrapping if needed)
  - **Mobile**: Centered alignment
  - **Desktop**: Left alignment
- Editable player names
- Reset functionality
- Info dialog with version and instructions

## Validation Rules
- Input validation is implemented for all score categories
- Validates ranges and step values (multiples) for each category
- Validation provides user feedback via input styling

## Mobile Optimization
- Input fields use `inputmode="numeric"` for mobile number keyboard
- Font size set to 16px to prevent iOS zoom on focus
- Responsive design with horizontal scroll for many players

## Technical Details
- State management via localStorage with key 'yatzy_scoreboard_v1'
- Categories defined in CATEGORIES array with keys, labels, icons, and types
- Calculated fields: sum_upper, bonus, total
- Input fields trigger validation on change/blur events
- CSS Media Queries control layout (break point at 600px)
- Always increase the version on each commit. Otherwise this will bring caching problems. It does not have to be a major version increase.
